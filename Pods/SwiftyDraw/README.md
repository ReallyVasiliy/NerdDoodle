## Overview

SwiftyDraw is a simple, light-weight drawing framework written in Swift. SwiftyDraw is built using Core Gaphics and is very easy to implement.

## Requirements
* iOS 9.1+
* Swift 4.2

## Installation

### Cocoapods:

SwiftyDraw is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'SwiftyDraw'
```

### Carthage

SwiftyDraw is also available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md). To install,
you can simply add the following line to your Cartfile for the latest version of SwiftyDraw.

```ruby
github "awalz/SwiftyDraw" "master"
```

### Manual Installation:

Simply copy the contents of the Source folder into your project.

## Usage

Using SwiftyDraw is very simple:

### Getting Started:

Simply create a SwiftyDrawView and add it to your View Controller:

```swift
let drawView = SwiftyDrawView(frame: self.view.frame)
self.view.addSubview(drawView)
```
    
By default, the view will automatically respond to touch gestures and begin drawing. The default color is **black**.

To disable drawing, simply set the `isEnabled` property to false:

```swift
drawView.isEnabled = false
```

## Brushes

For drawing, we use `Brush` to keep track of styles like `width`, `color`, etc.. We have multiple different default brushes, you can use as follows:

```swift
drawView.brush = Brush.default
```

The default brushed are:

```swift
public static var `default`: Brush { get } // black, width 3
public static var thin     : Brush { get } // black, width 2
public static var medium   : Brush { get } // black, width 7
public static var thick    : Brush { get } // black, width 10
public static var marker   : Brush { get } // flat red-ish, width 12
public static var eraser   : Brush { get } // white, width 8; currently this fakes an eraser by using the canvas' background color to draw
```

### Adjusted Width Factor

`SwiftyDrawView` supports drawing-angle-adjusted brushes. Effectively, that means, if the user (using an ï£¿Pencil) draws with the tip of the pencil, the brush will reduce its width a little. If the user draws at a very low angle, with the side of the pencil, the brush will be a little thicker.
You can modify this behavior by setting `adjustedWidthFactor` of a brush. If you increase the number (to, say, `5`) the changes will increase. If you reduce the number to `0`, the width will not be adjusted at all.
The default value is `1` which causes a slight increase in width.

This is an opt-in feature. That means, in `shouldBeginDrawingIn`, you need to manually put `drawingView.brush.adjustWidth(for: touch)`, to make it work.
That is, because you might not want to use it if you have implemented a zoom feature and want to disable it while the user is zooming to get better results.

## Further Customization:

For more customization, you can modify the different properties of a brush to fit your needs.

### Line Color:

The color of a line stroke can be changed by adjusting the `color` property of a brush. SwiftyDraw accepts any UIColor:

```swift
drawView.brush.color = .red
```
    
<p align="center">
  or
</p>

```swift
drawView.brush.color = UIColor(colorLiteralRed: 0.75, green: 0.50, blue: 0.88, alpha: 1.0)
```    
### Line Width:

The width of a line stroke can be changed by adjusting the `width` property of a brush. SwiftyDraw accepts any positive CGFloat:

```swift
drawView.brush.width = CGFloat(5.0)
```

### Line Opacity:

The opacity of a line stroke can be changed by adjusting the `lineOpacity` property. SwiftyDraw accepts a CGFloat between 0. and 1.0:

```swift
drawView.brush.opacity = CGFloat(0.5)
```
    
## Editing

### Clear All:

If you wish to clear the entire canvas, simply call the `clear` function:

```swift
drawView.clear()
``` 

### Drawing History:

```swift
drawView.undo()
``` 

...and redo:

```swift
drawView.redo()
``` 
    

## Apple Pencil Integration
Apple Pencil can be used for drawing in a SwiftyDrawView, just like a finger.  
Special features, however, regarding Apple Pencil 2 are only supported on iOS 12.1 and above versions.

### Apple Pencil 2 Double Tap action
#### Enable/ Disable pencil interaction
Apple Pencil interaction is enabled by default, but you can set `drawView.isPencilInteractive` to change that setting.
#### Pencil Events
When double tapping the pencil, SwiftyDraw will check the user preferences set in the system. If the preference is set to switch to eraser, SwiftyDraw will switch between normal and erasing mode; if set to last used tool, SwiftyDraw will switch between current and previous brush.

## Delegate

SwiftyDraw has delegate functions to notify you when a user is interacting with a SwiftDrawView. To access these delegate methods, simply make your View Controller conform to the `SwiftyDrawViewDelegate` protocol:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, SwiftyDrawViewDelegate
```

### There are five delegate methods

```swift
/// SwiftyDrawViewDelegate called when a touch gesture should begin on the SwiftyDrawView using given touch type
func swiftyDraw(shouldBeginDrawingIn drawingView: SwiftyDrawView, using touch: UITouch) -> Bool
    
/// SwiftyDrawViewDelegate called when a touch gesture begins on the SwiftyDrawView.
func swiftyDraw(didBeginDrawingIn drawingView: SwiftyDrawView, using touch: UITouch)

/// SwiftyDrawViewDelegate called when touch gestures continue on the SwiftyDrawView.
func swiftyDraw(isDrawingIn drawingView: SwiftyDrawView, using touch: UITouch)
    
/// SwiftyDrawViewDelegate called when touches gestures finish on the SwiftyDrawView.
func swiftyDraw(didFinishDrawingIn drawingView: SwiftyDrawView, using touch: UITouch)
    
/// SwiftyDrawViewDelegate called when there is an issue registering touch gestures on the  SwiftyDrawView.
func swiftyDraw(didCancelDrawingIn drawingView: SwiftyDrawView, using touch: UITouch)
```
